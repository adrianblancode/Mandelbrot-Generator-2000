Introduction

This is a mandelbrot generator with GPU acceleration coded in Java, it was made by Adrian Blanco and Casper Winsnes for our Introduction to Computer Science class in our first year at KTH. 

For GPU acceleration support we use AMDs library Aparapi which requires AMD APP SDK 2.5 if you wish to compile the project. Otherwise everything works out of the box with the .jar file
