Mandelbrot Generator 2000
----
This is a mandelbrot generator with GPU acceleration coded in Java, it also has support for several other features such as  antialiasing, julia sets, fullscreen and saving pictures. This program was made by Adrian Blanco and Casper Winsnes for our Introduction to Computer Science class in our first year at KTH. 

For GPU acceleration support we use AMDs library Aparapi which requires AMD APP SDK 2.5 if you wish to compile the project. Otherwise everything works out of the box with the .jar file
